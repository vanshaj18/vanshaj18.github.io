<blockquote> The discovery of gravitational waves has opened a new window in astronomy </blockquote>
Since the experimental verification of the gravitational waves which were predicted by the general theory of relativity, the word <em> multi-messenger </em> astronomy has taken the central stage of in astronomy research.

<blockquote>All the big, interesting events — like supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, and mergers are disruptive — Péter Mészáros, a theoretical astrophysicist at Penn State. They send out accelerated particles, photons, and waves in space-time.” </blockquote>

    Although the word recently came at fore-front but the essence was there before. As <b> Prof. Meszaros </b> says, every major event sends out information in some form or other. Earlier we had photons, electromagnetic waves, cosmic particles. <b>Max Karl Ernst Ludwig Planck </b> (or simply Planck) who first hypothesized the presence of photons while he was working on the problem of blackbody radiation. While, physicist <b> Wolfgang Pauli </b> first postulated their existence in the 1930s to explain conservation principles in beta decays. Austrian physicist <b> Victor Hess </b> made a series of ascents in a hydrogen balloon to take measurements of radiation in the atmosphere. Making an ascent to 5300 metres, he found the rate of ionization was some three times that at sea level and concluded that penetrating radiation was entering the atmosphere from above.
