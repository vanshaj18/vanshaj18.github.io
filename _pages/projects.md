    <h5><b>Dark Matter and Cosmology</b></h5>(<i>ongoing</i>) 
    <p align="justify">
       The large-scale structure of the universe on a scale less than 100 Mpc consists of a network of overdense and underdense regions. Their evolution depends on the initial conditions and content of dark energy, studying them is valuable in constraining the cosmological parameters. Underdensities, or cosmic voids, especially provide reliable testing grounds for large-scale structure formation, cosmological parameters, and dark energy. In our work, the evolution of an isolated spherical underdense region in a homogeneous, expanding background is studied for different dark energy models. We start with reviewing the evolution for an Einstein-de Sitter cosmology and then adding additional models in the accerlation equaiton. Throughout the work, we assumed the initial density profile to be an inverse-top-hat and the density contrast is set to delta=-0.8, as taken by <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.05286.pdf">previous studies</a>. <br/>

 <h5> <b>Ultra Compact X-Ray Binary</b> </h5>
  <p align="justify">
    One of the most interesting and poorly understood binary systems are the Ultra-Compact X-Ray binary (UCXB) system. Low Mass X-Ray Binary Systems (LMXB) subsets consist of an accretor and a donor star. Their possible configurations can be White Dwarfs(WD) or He stars as donors and NS/BH as their accretors with an orbital period of less than 80 minutes. UCXBs are essential objects that have attracted the attention of researchers across the world. UCXBs serve as laboratories for studying the physical mechanisms of accretion and the nature of compact objects in close proximity. In this work, we analysed the observational and stellar parameters of the Ultra-Compact X-Ray binary OGLE-UCXB-01, primarily following <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ac06a7">http://dx.doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/ac06a7</a>, to better understand how these systems work.

   <h5><b>Particle simulation on Geant4</b></h5>
   <p align="justify">
    Particle Physics phenomenology is field where one tries to understand the fundamental intereaction of particles of nature. Particle phenomenology bridges the high energy experiment with the theoretical understanding of the interaction. It therefore provides a basis for validating the theoretical predictions about the interaction processes. To efficiently work on validation, we need tools which can be used to do simulation of the theoretical predictions. For this very reason, a Monte-Carlo based simulation toolkit, the Geant4 project, was initiated in the context of the CERN RD44 R&D project, as a world-wide collaboration. Geant4 is a multi-purpose toolkit to explore the nature of collisions and energy loss of particles. The use is not limited to particle physics, but rather is used in fields where particle interaction is required, ranging from high energy physics to medical physics and space physics research. The physics component offers various simulations packages and tools to study the processes involved. The study uses the electromagnetic package to verify the Bethe-Bloch energy loss formula for charged particles developed mainly by Hans Bethe and analyse the extent of its validity.

   <h5><b>Fluid flow in microsize channels</b></h5>
   <p align="justify">
     The last few decades have observed an exponential growth in microfluidic technology. It has seen a lot of coverage in manipulating fluid and species flow in small volumes. With the development of new materials, such devices are becoming common in diagnostics due to long-range benefits. In health care systems, these are inexpensive, portable, and disposable, making them ideal for research and clinical applications, including biosensing, drug development, and chemical synthesis. Many theoretical models on blood flow in arteries have highlighted the impact of artery diameter and visco-elasticity on pulse wave propagation in application to blood flow. But only a few actual testing of these ideas in vivo have been recorded. Despite their large applications in the medical sector, there is a lack of systematic study on the shear effects and surface tension which are among crucial factors characterising essential attributes of the blood. Expanding on previous works, we analysed incompressible Navier Stokes equations with a power-law model to analyse blood flow velocity in two dimensions. We modelled the stenosed section as a simple compression and expansion model in a rectangular capillary. Our work showed that adhesion effect of platelets are more in stenosed regions and it resulted in creation of vortices due to increased shear rates which is the result of surface modulation. </p>

    <h5><b>Asteroseismology of stars</b></h5>
    <p align="justify">
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroseismology">Asteroseismology</a> is the study of the oscillations occuring inside a star by analysing the periodicity of the luminosity variations which leads to inferences about the internal structre of star which is otherwise beyound the scope of obervational astronomy. For a non-technical reader, as analogus to seismic oscillations or earthquakes on Earth, a star also experiences "quakes" or "oscillations" where different modes of oscillations occurs depending on the position inside the star, namely <i>P</i>, <i>G</i>, <i>F</i>, <i> Mixed</i> modes occurs inside the star. My work in the undergraduate project involed learning the asteroseismology theory and data analysis and reduction techniques used in the field by validating the theoretical framework, mainly following <a href="https://phys.au.dk/~jcd/evolnotes/LN_stellar_structure.pdf">Stellar Structure and Evolution</a> for theory and <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691162928/asteroseismic-data-analysis">Asteroseismic data analysis</a> for data analysis.

   <h5><b>Nuclear aspect of Astrophysics</b></h5>
   <p align="justify">
     Astrophysics is a multi-discipline area of research that requires grasping every significant concept in physics, from particle physics to fluid dynamics to quantum physics and gravitation. Nucleosynthesis is the formation of elements in the hot stellar stoves where temperatures are of the order of Million Kelvins. Every star begins its lifecycle from the ZAMS (zero-age-main-sequence) position in the HR (Hertzsprungâ€“Russell) diagram, evolving in many possible paths determined by its initial birth mass. A massive star begins up high in the HR diagram, evolve fast and dye spectacularly in the form of supernovas. In contrast, a low mass star starts in the lower position, evolve in an almost everlasting time frame and ends in the smallest possible "spheres". The element formation in the stars is dependent on the core temperature and therefore are many in number, namely  <i>pp-cycle</i>, <i>CNO-cycle</i>, <i>r-process</i>, <i>p-process</i>, <i>s-process</i>. My first undergrad project involved reviewing <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/0911.3965.pdf">previous works</a> on stellar evolution, element formation processes, and general academic research.
