Hi there! ‡§®‡§Æ‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡•á üòÉ <br>Welcome to my webpage. 

<!-- <p> Who am I?</p> -->

<p align="justify">
I'm a 4th year undergraduate student at the <a href="https://ph.iitr.ac.in/departments/PH/pages/index.html">Department of Physics</a>, <a href="https://new.iitr.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee</a> majoring in physics and mathematics. My research interest lies in astrophysics, cosmology and particle physics and am also interested in  fluid dynamics, general physics, numerical methods and algorithms like ML, Quantum Computing for their usefulness in these domains. </p> 

<p> <b> I'm currently working in cosmology under <a href="https://www.ststephens.edu/department-of-physics/dr-geetanjali-sethi/">Dr.Geetanjali Sethi</a> and on fluid dynamics under <a href="https://www.iitr.ac.in/~MA/Ameeya__Kumar_Nayak">Prof. Ameeya K. Nayak</a>.</b>

<p align="justify"> During my last three years, I was lucky enough to get selected for <a href="https://web-japps.ias.ac.in:8443/fellowship2020/lists/result.jsp">IAS SRFP 2020</a>, <a href="https://www.hbcse.tifr.res.in/data/national-initiative-on-undergraduate-sciences-nius">NIUS 2019</a> through which I was fortunate to work under <a href="http://chep.iisc.ac.in/Personnel/pages/jyothsna/index.html">Prof.Jyothsna R Komaragiri, <a href="https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=UOV5qTsAAAAJ&hl=en">Prof. Anwesh Mazumdar</a>. Refer to [<a href="/vanshaj-kerni/projects/">Research page</a>] for detailed description of the work. <br/> I'm also very grateful to all my professors for taking out there time to write recommendations on my behalf for the multitude of research internships and programs I have applied for.
