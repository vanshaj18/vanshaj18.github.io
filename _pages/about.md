Hello!  नमस्ते <br> 
<br>

<p>
  I'm a person of curious nature with love for science and technology. I'm working towards understanding the universe and our presence in. I like disucssing problems of societial and scientific importance working my way to a possible solution. I like healthy conversations on topics linking to nature, human mind, philosophy, science history, mathematics etc. somtimes I get overwhelmed by the amount of knowledge that's out there to grasp but then again not to hurry learning ... <i>a bit by bit.</i>

  I express my generous gratitude to all my professors for taking out their time to write recommendations for me for the multitude of research internships and programs I apply for.
