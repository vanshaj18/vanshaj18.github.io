Hi there! ‡§®‡§Æ‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡•á üòÉ <br>Welcome to my webpage. 

<!-- <p> Who am I?</p> -->

<p align="justify">
I'm a 4th year undergraduate student at the <a href="https://ph.iitr.ac.in/departments/PH/pages/index.html">Department of Physics</a>, <a href="https://new.iitr.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee</a> majoring in physics and mathematics. <br/> <br/> My research interest lies in astrophysics, cosmology and particle physics and am also interested in  fluid dynamics, general physics, numerical methods and algorithms like ML, Quantum Computing for their usefulness in these domains. </p> 

<p> <b> I'm currently working in cosmology under <a href="https://www.ststephens.edu/department-of-physics/dr-geetanjali-sethi/">Dr.Geetanjali Sethi</a> and on fluid dynamics under <a href="https://www.iitr.ac.in/~MA/Ameeya__Kumar_Nayak">Prof. Ameeya K. Nayak</a>.</b>
