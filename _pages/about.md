Hello! नमस्ते 
<br> 
<br>

<p>
  I am Vanshaj Kerni, a graduate student from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Roorkee, India, with a master's in physics. I am awardee of the department's gold medal for highest CGPA, member of the Indian Physics Association, Astronomical Society of India, American Physical Society and a legacy member of Indian Pulsar Timing Array. Currently, I work as Junior Research Scientist at Foilum Labs, Bangalore, working in Ethereum Blockchain.

Robert Frost's poetic musings is the compass guiding my journey. Choosing a path uncharted, I diverged from the well-trodden roads of engineering and medicine, embarking instead on a voyage fueled by my passion for physics. Today, I find myself navigating the realms of astrophysics and blockchain research, a testament to the divergent choices that shape our destinies.
