Hello! नमस्ते (Namaste) <br>Welcome to my webspace. 
<p> 
  I'm a 4th year undergraduate student at the <a href="https://ph.iitr.ac.in/departments/PH/pages/index.html">Department of Physics</a>, <a href="https://new.iitr.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee</a> majoring in physics. <br> <br> A curious learner interested in new developments in the field of physics and science. I love to think about possible solutions to problems in science and society, developing ideas to generate new keys using existing ones. I'm a quick learner, open to learning new areas & tools to understand the universe more clearly... <i>taking step a bit by bit.</i>

  I'm very grateful to all my professors for taking out their time to write recommendations on my behalf for the multitude of research internships and programs I have applied for.
