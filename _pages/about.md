Hello! नमस्ते (Namaste) <br>Welcome to my webspace. 
<p> 
  I'm a 4th year undergraduate student at the <a href="https://ph.iitr.ac.in/departments/PH/pages/index.html">Department of Physics</a>, <a href="https://new.iitr.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee</a>. <br> <br> I'm a person with curiosity for new developments in physics and science. A quick learner, open to new areas & tools to understand the universe more clearly. I like disucssing problems of societial and scientific importance working my way to a possible solution. I like healthy conversations on topics linking to nature, human mind, philosophy, science history, mathematics etc. somtimes I get overwhelmed by the amount of knowledge that's out there to grasp but then again not to hurry learning ... <i>a bit by bit.</i>

  I'm very grateful to all my professors for taking out their time to write recommendations on my behalf for the multitude of research internships and programs I have applied for.
