Hello! नमस्ते 
<br> 
<br>

<p>
  I am Vanshaj Kerni, a MS Physics graduate from the Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee with thesis in Astronomy from the Indian Institute of Astrophysics, Bangalore. I am an awardee of the department's gold medal for highest CGPA, current student member of the Indian Physics Association (IPA), Astronomical Society of India (ASI), American Physical Society (APS) and a legacy member of Indian Pulsar Timing Array Consortium. These days, I am working as a Junior Research Scientist at Foilum Labs, Bangalore. Working in a collaborative space on a big project the goal is to create a universal layer 2 (L2) for blockchains. The work is quite exciting learning about blockchain, bitcoin, ethereum and mathematics governing the security of it.

Robert Frost's poetic musings is the compass guiding my journey. Travelling into uncharted space, I diverged from the well-stepped roads of engineering and medicine, embarking instead on a voyage fueled by my passion for physics. Today, I find myself navigating the realms of astrophysics and blockchain research, a testament to the divergent choices that shape our destinies.
