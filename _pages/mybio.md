Apart from academics, I am fond of new technology, space travel, sci-fi movies, travelling and exploring new places. I love music with a particular liking for Indian Classical and old romantic songsâ€”I am also a beginner flautist who desires to learn saxophone and other wind instruments.

I also spend time in science promoting activites. I am involved with the <a href="https://iaac.space/en/">International Astronomy and Astrophysics Competition</a> as their official <a href="https://iaac.space/en/vankerni">Indian Ambassador</a> promoting astronomy and astrophysics to young talents. I am also involved with the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/physastroclubiitr/">Physics and Astronomy Club IIT Roorkee</a>, organising multiple events and programs for promoting physics and astronomy in and around IIT Roorkee.
