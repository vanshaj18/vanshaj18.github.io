  <p class="header-bar" style="font-family:Dancing Script, cursive">
      I was born in the small town of <a href="https://udhampur.nic.in/tourist-places/">Udhampur</a> in Jammu and Kashmir, where I spent my early school days learning and playing with friends. My family then moved to the <a href="https://jammu.nic.in/">city of Jammu</a>, where I did my high school and cleared the IIT exam. I was always curious about our meaning in the universe; science shows were my all-time favourite and led me to my current interests in physics, astrophysics, and space technology. I love to watch movies, with Interstellar being on top of my list and a MCU fan. My other interests is in musicâ€”I am a beginner flautist with a photographer inside me. I also like hiking, travelling and eating new dishes.</p>
  <h5 style="text-align:center"> Research Interests: </h5>
  <p> 
    My interest is in astrophysics, applied mathematics and quantum computing. Also interested in applied maths, numerical simulations, machine learning and observations. <p  style="font-family:Dancing Script, cursive"> As side interests, I love to read about quantum information in context to biology, role of quantum mechanics in living systems. I sometimes think on the possibilty of life beyound earth, and has written a medium article about the possibility.

      In Fall 2019, I was selected for the <a href="https://www.hbcse.tifr.res.in/data/national-initiative-on-undergraduate-sciences-nius">National Initiative of Undergraduate Sciences </a> giving me wonderful opportunity to work with <a href="https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=UOV5qTsAAAAJ&hl=en">Prof. Anwesh Mazumdar</a> on studying the internal structre of stars using the techniques of seismology. 
    </li>
    <li>
      During the winter of 2018, I did a small reading project work under the esteemed guidance of <a href="https://www.iitr.ac.in/~PH/anilgfph"> Prof. Anil Gourishetty</a> on understanding different nuclear processes for elemnet synthesis and stellar evolution in general.

  <p class="header-bar"> <h5> OutReach </h5>   
    I like spending time spreading the love for science and currently doing this by involving myself as the <a href="https://iaac.space/en/">International Astronomy and Astrophysics Competition</a> as their official <a href="https://iaac.space/en/vankerni">Indian Ambassador</a> promoting astronomy and astrophysics to young talents. I am also involved with the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/physastroclubiitr/">Physics and Astronomy Club IIT Roorkee</a>, organising multiple events and programs for promoting physics and astronomy in and around IIT Roorkee.
