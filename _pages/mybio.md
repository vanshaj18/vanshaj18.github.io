<p>My major research interest lies in astrophysics, cosmology and particle physics and am additionally interested in  fluid dynamics, general physics, numerical methods and algorithms like ML, Quantum Computing for their usefulness in these domains. </p> 

<p> During the year 2019, 2020, I got selected for <a href="https://web-japps.ias.ac.in:8443/fellowship2020/lists/result.jsp">IAS SRFP 2020</a>, <a href="https://www.hbcse.tifr.res.in/data/national-initiative-on-undergraduate-sciences-nius">NIUS 2019</a> through which I was fortunate to work under <a href="http://chep.iisc.ac.in/Personnel/pages/jyothsna/index.html">Prof.Jyothsna R Komaragiri, <a href="https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=UOV5qTsAAAAJ&hl=en">Prof. Anwesh Mazumdar</a> on particle physics simulation and asteroseismology respectively. Refer to [<a href="/vanshaj-kerni/projects/">Research page</a>] for detailed description of the work. I'm also very grateful to all my professors for taking out there time to write recommendations on my behalf for the multitude of research internships and programs I have applied for. 

<p>
Apart from academics, I am fond of new technology, space travel, sci-fi movies, travelling and exploring new places. I love music with a particular liking for Indian Classical and old romantic songsâ€”I am also a beginner flautist who desires to learn saxophone and other wind instruments.

I also spend time in science promoting activites. I am involved with the <a href="https://iaac.space/en/">International Astronomy and Astrophysics Competition</a> as their official <a href="https://iaac.space/en/vankerni">Indian Ambassador</a> promoting astronomy and astrophysics to young talents. I am also involved with the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/physastroclubiitr/">Physics and Astronomy Club IIT Roorkee</a>, organising multiple events and programs for promoting physics and astronomy in and around IIT Roorkee.
