  <p class="header-bar" style="font-family:Dancing Script, cursive">
      I was born in the small town of <a href="https://udhampur.nic.in/tourist-places/">Udhampur</a> in Jammu and Kashmir, where I spent my early school days learning and playing with friends. My family then moved to the <a href="https://jammu.nic.in/">city of Jammu</a>, where I did my high school and cleared the IIT exam. I was always curious about our meaning in the universe; science shows were my all-time favourite and led me to my current interests in physics, astrophysics, and space technology. I always loved Sci-fi movies, with Interstellar being on top of my list. Music particularly Indian Classical and old romantic songs r my favouriteâ€”I am also a beginner flautist who desires to learn saxophone and other wind instruments.</p>

  <h5 style="text-align:center"> Research Interests: </h5>
  <p> 
    My primary interests are in astrophysics, cosmology. I am also interested in applied maths, astronomy, numerical methods machine learning and quantum computing. <p  style="font-family:Dancing Script, cursive"> As side interests, I love to read about quantum information in context to biology, role of quantum mechanics in living systems. I sometimes think on the possibilty of life beyound earth, and has written a medium article about the possibility.

  <p class="header-bar"> <h5> OutReach </h5>   
    I like spending time spreading the love for science and currently doing this by involving myself as the <a href="https://iaac.space/en/">International Astronomy and Astrophysics Competition</a> as their official <a href="https://iaac.space/en/vankerni">Indian Ambassador</a> promoting astronomy and astrophysics to young talents. I am also involved with the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/physastroclubiitr/">Physics and Astronomy Club IIT Roorkee</a>, organising multiple events and programs for promoting physics and astronomy in and around IIT Roorkee.
